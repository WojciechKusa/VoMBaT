        When one fixes the recall level, the number of relevant documents (includes) that would be screened \
        manually and automatically is fixed. \
        Relevant documents included automatically are equal to TP, whereas includes left for a manual review are equal \
        to FN. \
        The number of irrelevant documents (excludes) that would be screened manually and automatically depends on the \
        models quality (TNR). \
        The higher the TNR score, the more irrelevant documents are excluded automatically (TN). \
        The remaining irrelevant documents need to be reviewed manually (FP).

        This page displays the expected number of documents that would be screened manually \
        and automatically, assuming one wants to achieve a specific recall level. \
        Values are presented as stacked barplots for eleven different values of TNR.
